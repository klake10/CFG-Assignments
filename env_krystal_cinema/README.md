## Notes For Isslem
I'm having trouble getting this to run but I've checked so many times and can't find what the problem is. 
In VS Code it shows no errors with the code but I am having a problem when I try to connect to "POST" it.
I write http://localhost:3000/api/book and I keep getting 404 NOT FOUND. 
I feel like it has to be a small fix, but I'm not sure what is wrong. 
I tried on Postman but now I am using the Thunder Client in VS Code.
